# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey
About me: 
I'm a disabled woman of color from an underprivileged immigrant family and faced numerous societal limitations. These include prematurely retiring from the pre-Olympic team due to a career-ending ankle injury, being unable to pursue a college education, and therefore being limited to only blue-collar careers. A few years ago, I experienced a life-changing work accident involving my dominant wrist, ending that career as well.

Despite losing all hope after the accident, I took a leap of faith and pursued my dream of getting a college degree after a decade-long gap. The journey was challenging, especially with the nerve damage in my dominant wrist, which made tasks like taking notes, typing for extended periods, and even using pen and paper for math courses quite difficult. It was through this journey that I discovered accessibility tools such as voice-to-text, handwriting recognition, and text-to-speech, which were integral in enabling me to keep up with my able-bodied peers and continue my degree.

This first-hand experience with tech's empowering potential helped me realize its ability to break barriers and create opportunities I could never have imagined. I'm motivated by the tech industry's commitment to inclusivity, equity, and accessibility. Hence, I am eager to find a sense of belonging in this community and aspire to make an impact on other peopleâ€™s lives, just as someone did on mine.

If granted the opportunity to join this industry, I aspire to create life-enhancing solutions and contribute to a more inclusive world.

Goals for This Course:
To gain the technical wherewithal to execute my goals.

My First Python Program:
```Python
print("Hello World!")
```
